# Athena Hack

An all-female hackathon at Queen Mary University in London. This hackathon has one challenge for all teams: to use your skills to create an idea that will help solve the plastic crisis that is currently plaguing the world in support of Plastic Oceans UK.

# StarFish

StarFish is an app developed for schools to help encourage children to be more mindful of their impact on the planet and raise awareness of the plastic crisis. 

Following the popularity of the [TrashTag](https://www.newsweek.com/trashtag-trash-tag-challenge-twitter-reddit-1359221), students are able to sign up for the app, take part in the TrashTag themselves, and share before and after pictures, which other students in the school can see. 

The image's authenticity is verified with its geotag and timestamp, and it is checked that the image depicts an environment before and after it has been tidied up. 

As students post pictures, they collect Stars, the currency used to unlock different virtual pets and accessories, and learn facts about the impact of plastic on the environment.
